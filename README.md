# Ocean Science Center Seminar
## October 19, 2017
### Danielle Quinn (danielle.quinn@.mun.ca)

This repository contains the code and datasets that will be used in the code-along demonstrations today.

If you want to actively code along with me, use the R script called "code-blank.R" it contains comments and an outline of what we'll be doing, but you'll need to type the code in as we go.

If you'd rather have the code in front of you while following along, use the R script called "code-complete.R", which contains all of the code, comments, and outline of today's seminar.

You're encouraged to take notes as a team [here](https://etherpad.net/p/osc-19october2017)!
